Google2Ixquick (g2i)
====================

# Overview
With recent versions of Opera it is impossible to remove Google as the default search engine from the start page and URL bar. This extension does the next best thing by rerouting all Google search queries through the far-superior privacy-friendly search engine Ixquick. It can be toggled on and off simply by clicking the extension icon and was not contributed by any member of the Ixquick team; simply by a developer who loves the service and didn't want to use Google.

# Browser Support
The extension is only intended to work with Opera.

# Installation
For most users, it is sufficient to drag the packed browser extension, named g2i.nex, into the browser extensions management page.

# Privacy Information
Contrary to the information given in the extensions information panel, the extension does not actually request privildges for all URLs. Instead, it operates on the following pages:
	* "http://*/search?*"
	* "https://*/search?*"
At no point will the extension ever communicate in any way with any process outside of Ixquick.
