	"description": "With recent versions of Opera it is impossible to remove Google as the default search engine from the start page and URL bar. This extension does the next best thing by rerouting all Google search queries through the far-superior privacy-friendly search engine Ixquick. It can be toggled on and off simply by clicking the extension icon and was not contributed by any member of the Ixquick team; simply by a developer who loves the service and didn't want to use Google.",
